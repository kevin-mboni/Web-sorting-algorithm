## Description

The Advanced Web Sorting Algorithms project is designed to showcase efficient sorting algorithms implemented using Spring Boot and Thymeleaf. It provides a simple web interface where users can input data and select from multiple sorting algorithms to observe their functionality and performance.

## Features

- **Selection of Algorithms**: Choose from popular sorting algorithms such as Heap Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Radix Sort, and Bucket Sort.
  
- **Dynamic Input**: Input any comma-separated list of integers to be sorted dynamically.
  
- **Interactive Web Interface**: Utilizes Thymeleaf templates to render HTML pages dynamically based on user inputs and algorithm selections.
